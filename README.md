# INCREMENTAL LEARNING PROJECT 
by Marco Ratta and Armando La Rocca

The implementation of the baselines are provided in ICARL.ipynb and LwF.ipynb and FT.ipynb

The loss with temperature is implemented in icarl_utils.py with some other utilities while cifar100.py and utils.py contains some tools that are useful for the dataset. 

Classifier.ipynb is a modified version of Icarl in which are added some methods that allows to use different classifiers. 

In ETE.ipynb there is the implentation of the End-to-end approach.
